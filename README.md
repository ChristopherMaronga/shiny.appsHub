# Shiny applications hub

This repository is a collection of **ALL** the Rshiny apps that I have authored both for professional research use as well projects/for fun (currently only 1 app in this category). Feel free to use the codes and ideas but please acknowledge the effort.

I will try so much in the future to use open source datasets to author the Shiny apps so that they can be reproduced. Unfortunately, many of the Shiny apps herein were built using secured data (Real research data) and thus **ONLY** the code is available and NO data for reproducibility.

I have worked for many years in Clinical trials and observational studies Data Management and processing, hence the recurring theme of the apps is majorly data management/reporting oriented and a little bit of analysis workflows. I have authored over 20 Rshiny apps but I choose to share the below just to showcase some of my coding style and app engineering
