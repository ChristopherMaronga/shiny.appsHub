# Shiny applications hub

This repository contains a collection of shiny apps that I create as pet projects/for fun. Feel free to use the codes and ideas but please acknowledge the effort.

Most are done with open source datasets and can be reproduced but a few are built using secured data and only code is available and NO data for reproducibility.
